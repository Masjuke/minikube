## Description

* Both Docker Swarm and Kubernetes are capable of running many of the same services but may require slightly different approaches to certain details. Getting to know each of the software can help make the decision when choosing the right tool for you container.

* Docker provides a simple solution that is fast to get started with while Kubernetes aims to support higher demands with higher complexity. For much of the same reasons, Docker has been popular among developers who prefer simplicity and fast deployments. At the same time, Kubernetes is used in production environments by many high profile internet companies running popular services.

### Comparison

Docker Swarm
Pros

```shell
* Easy and fast setup
* Works with other existing Docker tools
* Lightweight installation
* Open source
```

Cons

```shell
* Limited in functionality by what is available in the Docker API
* Limited fault tolerance
```
 

Kubernetes
Pros

```shell
* Open source and modular
* Runs well on any operating systems
* Easy service organisation with pods
* Backed by years of expert experience
```

Cons

```shell
* Laborious to install and configure
* Incompatible with existing Docker CLI and Compose tools
```



Installation and Setup
Every tool has its own installation and setup process. Managing containers in the Cloud or other infrastructure depends a lot on how it is set up in the first place. In comparison, Kubernetes is not user-friendly.

When it comes to installation and setup, it can give developers a hard time. Firstly, it needs to be reconfigured for every operating system(OS). The online documentation helps a lot in the process; however, things can get complex while building a custom environment. The only solution is to use Google to your advantage. Another key reason why Kubernetes is not easy to setup and install is the planning that is required before you start implementing. You need to plan the nodes and that can take a lot of time and effort. The last nail in the coffin is the need for manual integrations. Not everything can be automated, and that makes Kubernetes hard to manage.

So, where does Docker stands in comparison to Kubernetes in this regard?

Docker, thanks to its Command Line Interface (CLI), is easy to setup and manage. The Docker Swarm uses CLI and GIT-like semantics. This makes it easy for application developers to incorporate new technologies into their workflow. In comparison with Kubernetes, you don’t need to learn new things when implementing the container for new OS or environment.

Overall, Docker wins hands-down when it comes to setup and installation.

Monitoring and Logging
Once the containers are deployed, the next step is to monitor the cluster of nodes. Both Kubernetes and Docker succeed in offering a good monitoring and logging process.

For Kubernetes, there is more than one way to monitor and log the clusters. You can use any of the following ways to do so:

Logging: Kibana (ELK) or Elasticsearch

Monitoring: Grafana, Heapster, or Influx

For Docker, there is no in-built library or process for monitoring or logging. However, developers can use third-party applications for monitoring and logging purposes. Some of the good examples of 3rd party monitoring tools are Sumo Logic, Retrace, Reimann, and DataDog.

Size and Performance
The basic philosophy behind the use of container services is the scalability they offer. Both platforms are highly scalable and support thousands of containers at a particular time. Initially, Docker didn’t have a great support for a large number of containers. However, with new updates, it can support as many containers as Kubernetes. Both the systems roughly support 1000 node clusters. The 1000 node clusters can support up to 30,000 containers.

Performance wise, Kubernetes holds a good ground against Docker. However, the research done by an independent body revealed that Docker could spin containers five times faster than Kubernetes.

Let’s try to understand the differences we have discussed until now, using a table.


Kubernetes Vs. Docker
Kubernetes

Docker

Most mature solution in the market.

Docker offers good features, but limited by its API.

Kubernetes is also the most popular solution in the market.

Docker’s market is relatively weaker compared to Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is hard to setup and configure.

Docker’s setup and installation is easy.

Kubernetes offers inbuilt logging and monitoring tools.

Docker only supports 3rd party monitoring and logging tools.

CPU utilization is a big factor in autoscaling.

It is possible to scale services manually.

Conclusion
Kubernetes is widely accepted by the community of developers, despite the hard installation process. The sole reason behind its popularity is the flexibility it offers and also the fact that it is backed by Google, one of the leading tech giants. Docker, on the other hand, has a small community. It is growing slowly, but it is hard to speculate whether it will ever beat Kubernetes.

The large community of Kubernetes means new tools, features, and support. If you are a small developer, who wants to learn container services, then Docker can be a great place to get started with. And, that’s the sole reason why you will find beginner educational content surrounding Docker rather than Kubernetes.
