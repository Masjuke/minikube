* If you don’t specify a CPU limit for a Container, then one of these situations applies:

`The Container has no upper bound on the CPU resources it can use. The Container could use all of the CPU resources available on the Node where it is running.`

`The Container is running in a namespace that has a default CPU limit, and the Container is automatically assigned the default limit. Cluster administrators can use a LimitRange to specify a default value for the CPU limit.
Motivation for CPU requests and limits.`

By configuring the CPU requests and limits of the Containers that run in your cluster, you can make efficient use of the CPU resources available on your cluster’s Nodes. By keeping a Pod’s CPU request low, you give the Pod a good chance of being scheduled. 

By having a CPU limit that is greater than the CPU request, you accomplish two things:

- The Pod can have bursts of activity where it makes use of CPU resources that happen to be available.
- The amount of CPU resources a Pod can use during a burst is limited to some reasonable amount.
