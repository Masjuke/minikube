## Installing Minikube on local machine 

Minikube is a tool as a replacement for kubernetes if we want to use in local machine, some features might be not provided compare to real kubernetes.

This installation is intended to Mac laptop since this is the most apropriate environment instead using remote linux server or vagrant at my place. but don't worries we'll not be losing the main purpose of why we do this test :

    * Deploy container 
    * Volume
    * Scheduler
    * Replicas
    * CPUs
    * Memory and so on
