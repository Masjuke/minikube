### Scale replicas of a container

* ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. However, a Deployment is a higher-level concept that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to pods along with a lot of other useful features. Therefore, we recommend using Deployments instead of directly using ReplicaSets, unless you require custom update orchestration or donâ€™t require updates at all.
This actually means that you may never need to manipulate ReplicaSet objects: use a Deployment instead, and define your application in the spec section.



```shell
# Scale replica for container with specific namespace
kubectl scale --replicas=4 --namespace=development  deployment/mynginx
deployment "mynginx" scaled
```


```shell
# Scale replica for container with default namespace
kubectl scale --replicas=4 deployment/mynginx
deployment "mynginx" scaled
```
